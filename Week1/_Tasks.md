## Instructions
- Name the file - Summary01_\<Pair Name\>.docx
- You can submit the summaries in pairs or individually, working in pairs should reduce your workload quite a bit. Please give the names of both the pair members in the file and also declare the same on the Discord. 
- Summaries will be checked by me. Submission of fewer than (n-1) summaries will result in deratification.
